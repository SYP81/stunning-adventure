Background: 
I am an Australian that is currently working in the world of finance. I am studying to be a financial planner. I'm also interested in learning about business and my favourite thing to do is travel.

Interest in IT: Because I work in the finance industry I have a particular interest in fin-tech companies. My interest in IT started back in 2013 when I learned about the debtor finance product and how you can purchase an invoice from a business and sell it to a third party. I chose to study at RMIT because this was the best university for the degree I'm studying. From my studies Im expecting to learn how to better work with teams, organise projects and complete tasks. Im also expecting to learn the important components of financial planning.
