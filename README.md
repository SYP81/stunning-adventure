Background: 

I am an Australian that is currently working in the world of finance. I am studying to be a financial planner. I'm also interested in learning about business and my favourite thing to do is travel.

Interest in IT: Because I work in the finance industry I have a particular interest in fin-tech companies. My interest in IT started back in 2013 when I learned about the debtor finance product and how you can purchase an invoice from a business and sell it to a third party. I chose to study at RMIT because this was the best university for the degree I'm studying. From my studies Im expecting to learn how to better work with teams, organise projects and complete tasks. Im also expecting to learn the important components of financial planning.

Auditory
If you are an auditory learner, you learn by hearing and listening. You understand and remember things you have heard. You store information by the way it sounds, and you have an easier time understanding spoken instructions than written ones. You often learn by reading out loud because you have to hear it or speak it in order to know it.

As an auditory learner, you probably hum or talk to yourself or others if you become bored. People may think you are not paying attention, even though you may be hearing and understanding everything being said.

Here are some things that auditory learners like you can do to learn better.

Sit where you can hear.
Have your hearing checked on a regular basis.
Use flashcards to learn new words; read them out loud.
Read stories, assignments, or directions out loud.
Record yourself spelling words and then listen to the recording.
Have test questions read to you out loud.
Study new material by reading it out loud.
Remember that you need to hear things, not just see things, in order to learn well.


Personality Test Results

Commanders are natural-born leaders. People with this personality type embody the gifts of charisma and confidence, and project authority in a way that draws crowds together behind a common goal. However, Commanders are also characterized by an often ruthless level of rationality, using their drive, determination and sharp minds to achieve whatever end they’ve set for themselves. Perhaps it is best that they make up only three percent of the population, lest they overwhelm the more timid and sensitive personality types that make up much of the rest of the world – but we have Commanders to thank for many of the businesses and institutions we take for granted every day.


Happiness Lies in the Joy of Achievement
If there’s anything Commanders love, it’s a good challenge, big or small, and they firmly believe that given enough time and resources, they can achieve any goal. This quality makes people with the Commander personality type brilliant entrepreneurs, and their ability to think strategically and hold a long-term focus while executing each step of their plans with determination and precision makes them powerful business leaders. This determination is often a self-fulfilling prophecy, as Commanders push their goals through with sheer willpower where others might give up and move on, and their Extraverted (E) nature means they are likely to push everyone else right along with them, achieving spectacular results in the process.
At the negotiating table, be it in a corporate environment or buying a car, Commanders are dominant, relentless, and unforgiving. This isn’t because they are cold-hearted or vicious per se – it’s more that Commander personalities genuinely enjoy the challenge, the battle of wits, the repartee that comes from this environment, and if the other side can’t keep up, that’s no reason for Commanders to fold on their own core tenet of ultimate victory.


If there’s anyone Commanders respect, it’s someone who is able to stand up to them intellectually, who is able to act with a precision and quality equal to their own. Commander personalities have a particular skill in recognizing the talents of others, and this helps in both their team-building efforts (since no one, no matter how brilliant, can do everything alone), and to keep Commanders from displaying too much arrogance and condescension. However, they also have a particular skill in calling out others’ failures with a chilling degree of insensitivity, and this is where Commanders really start to run into trouble.


Cultivating the Science of Human Relationships
Emotional expression isn’t the strong suit of any Analyst type, but Commanders’ distance from their emotions is especially public, and felt directly by a much broader swath of people. Especially in a professional environment, Commanders will simply crush the sensitivities of those they view as inefficient, incompetent or lazy. To people with the Commander personality type, emotional displays are displays of weakness, and it’s easy to make enemies with this approach – Commanders will do well to remember that they absolutely depend on having a functioning team, not just to achieve their goals, but for their validation and feedback as well, something Commanders are, curiously, very sensitive to.


Commanders are true powerhouses, and they cultivate an image of being larger than life – and often enough they are. They need to remember though, that their stature comes not just from their own actions, but from the actions of the team that props them up, and that it’s important to recognize the contributions, talents and needs, especially from an emotional perspective, of their support network. Even if they have to adopt a "fake it ‘til you make it" mentality, if Commanders are able to combine an emotionally healthy focus alongside their many strengths, they will be rewarded with deep, satisfying relationships and all the challenging victories they can handle.


Project Idea

Online Invoice Market Website

Overview: A place for businesses to sell their invoices at a discount in return for early payment. Investors can bid on an invoice and the market website will act as the conduit ensuring integrity and trasnparency.

In 2018 over 60 billion dollars worth of invocies were sold to debtor finance companies. Usually a facility is setup with a debtor finance business and the seller can only sell to one buyer. If a platform were provided for sellers to present their invoice on the open market then the buyer will have less power when it comes to dictating the terms. The market will make is more competitve driving down the price for the seller which means they wont need to sell on terms decided by the buyer.

Features: 

The features for this platform are as follows.

Once a profile is created we are going to provide users with a bidder dashbaord. This is where each user will be able to monitor each bid on the item they would like to participate in. 


Each incvoice up for auction will be subject to a start and end time block. This will give bidders a limited amount of time to bid on an item. 


The website will also provide images of the item they are bidding on. Other features of the website will include Starting Bid, buy it now price, reserve price, item value. 



Software/Hardware:

This is a small project so we are going to use software that is a better fit for a project this size. For this website we will be using WordPress software with the auctions plugin, this will give us the framework to allow investors to bid for the asset. We are going to use a Linux hosting account for memory because it is one of the most reliable operating systems for webservers and has more features than its major competitor Windows. For the webhosting software we will be using Bluehost simply because it has many of the same features as other popular hosting software but has a better reputation when it comes to security.



Skills Required

The following skills are going to be required to build a website. 

Programming Skills, Design Skills, Webskills, FTP Skills and also other skills such as time management, problem solving and team work skills. Both hard and soft skills are required to build a website.
