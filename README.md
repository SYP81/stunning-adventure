Background: 

I am an Australian that is currently working in the world of finance. I am studying to be a financial planner. I'm also interested in learning about business and my favourite thing to do is travel.

Interest in IT: Because I work in the finance industry I have a particular interest in fin-tech companies. My interest in IT started back in 2013 when I learned about the debtor finance product and how you can purchase an invoice from a business and sell it to a third party. I chose to study at RMIT because this was the best university for the degree I'm studying. From my studies Im expecting to learn how to better work with teams, organise projects and complete tasks. Im also expecting to learn the important components of financial planning.

Project Idea

Online Invoice Market Website

Overview: A place for businesses to sell their invoices at a discount in return for early payment. Investors can bid on an invoice and the market website will act as the conduit ensuring integrity and trasnparency.

In 2018 over 60 billion dollars worth of invocies were sold to debtor finance companies. Usually a facility is setup with a debtor finance business and the seller can only sell to one buyer. If a platform were provided for sellers to present their invoice on the open market then the buyer will have less power when it comes to dictating the terms. The market will make is more competitve driving down the price for the seller which means they wont need to sell on terms decided by the buyer.
